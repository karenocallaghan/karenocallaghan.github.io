	Week 2 Lesson - Code Challenge:
	Take the CV site you created last week and do the following:
	Use ID's and Classes to re-style your website. You will need to go to W3 Schools to find out how to do the following:
	-Add text shadow to your headings
	-Underline and bold key words in your CV. You can use a <span> tag to target a specific word in a <p> tag or similar.
	-Change the style of one of the lists on your page so that the bullet points appear differently
	-Use HTML to create a link that when clicked jumps between headings on the page (you will need enough content on the page so that the user would need to scroll)
	
	Week 3 Lab: 
	Update your CV from the last week to be a FlexBox responsive design. Design is mostly up to you but for full marks your design should:
	- Have 3 columns at some point in the design
	- Use Justified Content
	- Use a media query to change some aspect of your design at smaller widths
	
	Week 6 Lab:
	Take a copy of your existing CV site and modify it to use Bootstrap as its grid system. 
	You may also use any of the Bootstrap components that you like, but you will be graded on your responsive design using Bootstrap. 
	When you have completed your work, commit it to GitHub and submit a Word/Text document with a link to the repository.
